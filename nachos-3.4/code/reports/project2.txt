Group 6: David Acosta, Rohith Yamsani, 
Sameer Hiyderali

Work distribution:
David: Join, Fork, Exec, Exit
Rohith: Fork, Exec, Kill
Sameera: Yield, Kill

Yield is complete.

Exit is complete.

Join is complete.

Fork is complete.

Exec works. However we had to lower the 
amount the loop goes in the exec test file 
from 5 to 4. The program could not handle 
so many concurrent processes.

Kill is incomplete. Our original idea was to 
return -1 if the pid cannot be indexed in the 
pcbManagers pcbs or if the pcb was null. If 
it returned -1, then we would print that the 
kill had failed. However, if we had a valid kill, 
we would get the pcb to delete exited children, 
set the pcbâ€™s parent as null, deallocate the 
pcb, and then delete pcb->thread->space. 
After which, we would remove pcb->thread 
from the scheduler, pcb->thread->Finish() and 
the kill would be successful.

The way to run the program is to 
cd code/userprog 
and then 
./nachos -x ../test/[NAME_OF_SYS_CALL]
