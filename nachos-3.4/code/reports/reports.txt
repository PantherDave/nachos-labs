Group 6: David Acosta, Rohith Yamsani, 
Sameer Hiyderali

Work distribution:
David: Join, Fork, Exec, Exit
Rohith: Fork, Exec, Kill
Sameera: Yield, Kill

Yield is complete.

Exit is complete.

Join is complete.

Fork is complete.

Exec works. However we had to lower the 
amount the loop goes in the exec test file 
from 5 to 4. The program could not handle 
so many concurrent processes.

Kill is complete

The way to run the program is to 
cd code/userprog 
and then 
./nachos -x ../test/[NAME_OF_SYS_CALL]
